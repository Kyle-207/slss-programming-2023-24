# A bot that asks the user what their favourite
# food is. Based on that food, it will classify
# the type/genre/cuisine of the food, then
# give a restaurant suggestion.

# Introduce the bot to the user
# Ask the user what their favourite food is
print("Hello, I am here to suggest you a restaurant.")

# Add another cuisine that our bot should make a suggestion for

# If they answer with Italian food,
# Suggest an Italian restaurant
