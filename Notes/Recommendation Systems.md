# Popularity and Likes

This type of paradigm makes a suggestion based on how many
people like the thing.

One prime example of this, is the like button (heart) in Instagram.
When you click that heart, Instagram records it, and based on information it has on you, it might suggest that to someone else that is similar to you.
